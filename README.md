# Widefield Plate Solver

This package provides tools for plate solving wide field astronomical images.
Its main difference with using Astrometry.net's `solve-field` directly is that it can also default to Astrometry.net's API if 
requested. 


## Installation

To install the package, run:
```
pip install .
```

from the root directory of this package.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the command `widefield-plate-solve` from the terminal:

```
widefield-plate-solve <fits_file_path> --use_api
```
Replace `<fits_file_path>` with the path to your FITS file. 
Use the `--use_api` flag to use the Astrometry.net API for plate solving: Your environment variables will need to contain your
API key.
Not using `--use_api` will default to your local installation of Astrometry.net, looking for the `solve-field` command.

For more information on usage, run:

```
widefield-plate-solve --help
```
